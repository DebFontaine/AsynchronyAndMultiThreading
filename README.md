# AsynchronyAndMultiThreading

This is just a demo winforms app I crated to help explain the basics of Threads, Task, and TPL. Nothing too fancy. I just have a few code examples illustrating various concepts. The user can choose the example type from a dropdown, see the code in the left panel, run the code and see the result in the right panel. There is a 3rd section with some comments\notes giving a bit more detail and hopefuly explaining things a bit more.
